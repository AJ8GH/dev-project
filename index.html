  <p>6 weeks ago I jumped into a career change - I was previously in tech-recruitment - embarking
    on an intensive 16 week software development bootcamp with Makers. There's one question which
    comes up a lot when I speak to people about it and I still don't have a great answer.</p>

  <p class="quote"><em><strong>"So what type of development do you want to do?"</em></strong></p>

  <p>Makers academy is about buidling a solid foundation of fundamental skills to help you
    to be a successful professional software developer. Rather than any particular language,
    framework, or specialism these are based around industry wide best practices, concepts and
    processes, such as test driven development and object oriented design. So whether you want to
    do frontend, backend, JavaScript or Python, applying skills learned at makers will give allow
    you to be successful in any discipline or language. </p>

  <p>Whilst I feel that I have made significant progress in the relatively short time that I've
    been coding, I'm still starting out on my development journey and career. So it's
    understandable that I don't have everything decided yet. As for which development path is
    right, there are many options and it's more than a bit confusing when you're just starting out.
    Backend, Web, Frontend, data... Add lanaguages to the mix and the amount of choice starts to
    feel overwhelming, emphasised by the fact that you just don't know enough yet to make an
    informed decision. So whilst I'm certain that coding in general is what I want to do, the rest
    is less clear.</p>

  <p class="quote"><strong>The more you know,<br>the more you realise you don't know</strong></p>

  <p>An important lesson I'm constantly learning is that it's ok not to know things (yet!). As I
    gain more experience and knowledge during the program, I'll reassess my options and begin
    forming a loose plan of what I want to do. I know that I still won't have it all figured out
    for a little while longer, but that's ok too.</p>

  <p>As a developer, the more you learn, the more you realise you still  don't know (yet!). I'm not
    sure when, or if, that will ever change. Sure, it's unsettling at first, but rather than be
    frustrated by that, it's essential to enjoy the process of discovering something you don't know
    (yet!), learning how it's done and practising until you've got it down and can literally do it
    with your eyes closed.</p>

  <p>One day soon I'm sure I'll have a great and confident answer to that question. Until then,
    I'll be learning as much as I can about each specialism, filling in the gaps in my
    knowledge and enjoying the learning process.</p>
